5. Below are the websites that I went to for help
6. Had some valuable feed back.
7. Others on Git Hub
## Basic Instruction

## Notes

* Screens smaller than 800px wide are treaded differently than large screens to help prevent blocking information with the list.  This includes autocallapse of the list, smaller infowindows, and no panorama on smaller screens.
* Most points have a panorama or streetview nearby.  Those will open one in the infowindow if so.
* Session storage is used, so information will only pull once per point until you close that tab.  This speeds up clicking a point again and reduces api calls.
* This tool uses Knockout, jquery, and also includes modernizr in hopes of further cross browser support.  A modern browser is still recommended.
* The page is responsive but it is not intended for mobile viewing on small devices.  If you are viewing on a mobile phone, landscape is recommended as the width of the list is fixed.
* Foursquare API powers the site information outside of the map and panorama.
* Google maps api v3 powers the maps and panoramas.
* Points used are not very interesting for the most part.  They are for demonstration purposes mainly and were not carefulyl picked.

I want to say thank you to everyone on the Udacity Forums that helped me through this one as well as others on Git Hub.
